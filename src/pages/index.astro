	<h3 class='summary'>I'm designing software at <Link url={employerURL} text={employer} />, working on tools supporting mission planning, sequencing and spacecraft visualization for <a href='https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mars 2020</a> and <a href='https://europa.nasa.gov/' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Europa Clipper</a>.</h3>

	<p>I spend a lot of my time designing digital tools and interactive experiences, but I also make art, furniture, objects, lights and sounds. A few of the things I've been working on: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>An open-source <Link url='https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie' text='framework for modeling spacecraft' /> with a lot of great people at JPL.</li>
		<li>Science targeting and terrain visualization tools <Link url='https://youtu.be/4OY0YCdFDpU?t=2323' text='ASTTRO' /> & <Link url='https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/mars-virtual-reality-software-wins-nasa-award' text='OnSight' /> â€” used on daily operations for Perseverance and Opportunity.</li>
		<li>A simplified public version of the Mars terrain visualization tools above: <Link url="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/surface-experience/?drive=1222\&site=26" text='Explore with Perseverance' /> </li>
		<li>A design system to support data-rich and complex patterns commonly found in spacecraft planning: <Link url="https://github.com/nasa-jpl/stellar" text='Stellar Design System' /> </li>
