## Carl Sagan ([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7s664NsLeFM))

> If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe. 

I've been thinking a lot about how interconnected and interdependent everything is. All the natural world exists within a set of rules that are built from a few small building blocks. I'm trying to use this as a reminder to use existing tools, approaches, and patterns in the act of creation. 

Sometimes it's easy to try and do _everything_ in a completely new way, to the point that I get massively creatively blocked and can't seem to put anything out into the world. I'm hoping that remembering helps me get unblocked.
